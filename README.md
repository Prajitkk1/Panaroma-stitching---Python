# Panaroma-stitching---Python
Looking to merge images and create a panaromic view?

Working:

1. Stitch.py file contains all the code. just run stitch.py --"argument" (The argument is the directory in which the images are present)
2. To try run stitch.py --extra1
3. The output will get stored as panaroma.jpg in the same folder you give as input

Limitations:
1. Might not work when we try to pass more than 5 images

Advantages:
1. The images can be of any order, the algorithm will find the next suitable image with highest number of matching features and stitch them
